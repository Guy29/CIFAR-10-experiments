### Neural Networks module coursework

In this notebook I investigate the effectiveness of different architectures of convolutional neural network in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The effects of variations in loss function, choice of optimizer, learning rate (and learning rate schedulers), dropout rate, and batch normalization are examined, as well as the effect of implementing transfer learning.
